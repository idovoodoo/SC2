Snap Clutch Development Version
-------------------------------

Here are a quick set of instructions for use.

1. Getting started
Calibrate and so on. This version is only compatible with Tobii I'm afraid.

I have added some preset modes (in the Mode Setup tab) to allow you to switch between sets of 'modes' for World of Warcraft, Second Life, Free Realms or whatever.
If you select one of these and then activate them. Any warning messages will appear in the text box to the right.
The experimental modes are experimental and take control of the mouse in a different way than ordinary mouse emulation so be careful!

2. Click Start to start!
You then must Alt+Tab to the game (I disabled the auto game switching function).
DO NOT run any games in full screen! They work best when run in a window!!

3. F10 can be used to start and stop Snap Clutch

4. Dwelling at a location off the bottom of the screen, such as a point on the eye tracker will also stop Snap Clutch.

5. Snap Clutch starts off in "no mode". To activate one of the others then gesture/glance/flick your eyes off one of the screen edges to activate.

This should be enough to get you started but please email me if you have any difficulties (svickers@dmu.ac.uk).
